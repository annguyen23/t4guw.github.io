    Currently, there are not resources to find straightforward Unity mechanic tutorials that are comprehendible,
    correct, and realistic. For example, there are YouTube videos that are lengthy and hard to follow for basic
    mechanics. Various forums such as Stack Overflow can also be more harmful to novice game developers by being
    outdated, time-consuming, or providing code snippets without being fully tested. Using the resources previously
    mentioned, these can make learning Unity a greater challenge than it needs to be, and cause discouragement among new
    game developers. 100 Unity Mechanics for Programmers strives to change these hardships by offering 100 uncomplicated
    game mechanics, of which all include: step-by-step tutorials, working demonstrations, and source codes for the
    developer to learn from and experiment with.
  </p>
  <p>
    With previous game development experience and wanting to improve my skills, I joined this project last quarter to
    continue the work that was started by the previous capstone student. Last quarter, I worked alongside another
    capstone student to create these mechanics. We would communicate to each other to ensure that our in-progress
    mechanics were not redundant.
  </p>
  <p>
    When brainstorming new mechanics to implement, I would think back to when I took Introduction to Game Development
    and the mechanics that I used or saw other game developers use. Another way I would come up with mechanic ideas was
    from video games that I was currently playing or games I had played before. Once I had an idea, I would then outline
    the idea by writing down the process of making it to make sure it was plausible and reasonable. After I was done
    implementing the mechanic, I created the step-by-step tutorial of what I did and created a WebGL demo of it. All of
    this was then compiled together and uploaded to the GitHub repository with the previously implemented mechanics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the list of 100 mechanics is completed, future capstone students can be tasked to refine, improve, and keep
    each mechanic up to date, with the hopes of assisting novice game developers. The overall goal of the project is to
    maintain a helpful resource of basic and simple game mechanics to new developers.
