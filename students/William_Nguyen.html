      The summer U.W. project was not nearly as productive as intended. This was merely a section of the original content as
      I was intending to provide full business strategies and 1,3, and 5 year plans for the university. However, the largest
      obstacle was in collecting data effectively in the collegiate esports and esports industry. There is very little
      factual information available in the industry, requiring the need for expert opinions as a basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuit of expert opinions, I attempted to contact a variety of organizations in esports and collegiate esports
      circuit. We created a short survey of questions that would maximize relevant information areas and topics in the
      industry while having very little time commitment (10 short answer questions). We received less than 5 response after
      4 weeks of asking network industry professionals via direct messaging or emails. After reevaluating the strategy of
      contact, I am likely to pursue more official means of contact with administrative support to convey official nature
      and meaning of questions. Overall, I underestimated the difficulty of getting data from the industry to create
      reasonable conclusions from. I was unsure how to proceed oftentimes as this was very independent. I tried to make
      decisions based on the network and information I had currently, but was out of my depth on what the administration
      wanted specifically due to limited opportunities to update as well as their lack of experience in this field and their
      needs. Overall, I should have been more structured and prepared for an independent project.
