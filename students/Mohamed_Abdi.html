      The objective for this capstone project was to design and develop a mobile application for Abubakar Islamic Center in
      Tukwila, WA. The community at this mosque is growing and as technology is advancing the mosque felt a need for change
      on how they share information through the community. This mobile app provides an alternative communication channel for
      Abubakar Islamic Center to inform people all at once whether its prayer times, events or other important information.
      The creation and release of this technology will make the lives of those who visit the mosque more convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project began in August 2018 by a single student who designed, developed, and tested the whole mobile app. They
      gather requirements from their sponsor and research the necessary tools needed to create the application. The data was
      stored remotely that an admin can access and modify. The app was programmed with React Native a JavaScript framework
      thatâ€™s capable of running both on Android and iOS. It utilizes Firebase as Mobile Backend as a Service and Google
      Sheets as a Database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The iterative development process used for this project was first to set goals and understanding sponsor requirement,
      second is creating wireframe, third is define user scenarios for the wireframes, fourth is building the prototype,
      fifth is User testing, and the final step is present the prototype to sponsors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project required testing on different software versions (i.e. Android 7, Android 8, etc.), screen sizes, and
      operating systems (Android and iOS). Apps were tested with Android and iOS Emulators for each component in the app it
      would be tested till outcomes were satisfied with the expected results. User Testing was another approach taken in
      process to test out the mobile app a total of 17 people have testedit. After months of meeting with a sponsor,
      redesigning features and testing the application is close to completion.
