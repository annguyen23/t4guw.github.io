    The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects employment in computer and information technology occupations to grow
    11 percent from 2019 to 2029, which is a much faster growth rate average when compared across all occupations. In a
    world that is increasingly dependent on computers, the employment outlook for computer science students should
    continue to be a bright spot in the jobs sector. Despite this, computer science majors have one of the highest
    unemployment rates post-graduation. In 2020, the unemployment rate of newly graduated computer science majors was
    4.5% compared to an overall unemployment rate of 2.8%. Data trends suggest that this unemployment rate will continue
    to grow as universities struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape of the computer science hiring process.
  </p>
  <p>
    More and more, computer science majors are being asked to demonstrate skills beyond what is generally emphasized in
    most computer science majors during a technical interview, particularly in the realm of creative problem solving. To
    bridge the gap between what is taught in university and what is expected in a technical interview, myself and other
    members of the Tech for Good research group at University of Washington Bothell hosted problem solving workshops and
    online courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the span of two quarters, I hosted 14 problem solving workshops focused on identifying approaches to data
    structures and algorithms questions commonly asked in technical interviews. In post-workshop surveys, 80% of
    participants who were currently enrolled in CSS 342 or CSS 343 reported that they learned new information that had
    not yet been covered in their studies at UWB and 100% of the participants reported that they felt more prepared for
    technical interviews after attending the workshops. Among participants who had already completed CSS 342 and CSS
    343, 71% reported that they learned something new and 86% reported feeling more prepared for technical interviews
    after attending the workshops. The workshops fill a clear need in studentsâ€™ education. Adapting the undergraduate
    curriculum to align with the demands of the computer science industry is the only way to ensure every student is
    successful after graduation.
