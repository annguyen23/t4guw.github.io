  The objective for this capstone project was to design and develop a mobile application for Abubakar Islamic Center in
  Tukwila, WA. The community at this mosque is growing and as technology is advancing the mosque felt a need for change
  on how they share information through the community. This mobile app provides an alternative communication channel for
  Abubakar Islamic Center to inform people all at once whether its prayer times, events or other important information.
  The creation and release of this technology will make the lives of those who visit the mosque more convenient.
</p>
<p>
  The project began in August 2018 by a single student who designed, developed, and tested the whole mobile app. They
  gather requirements from their sponsor and research the necessary tools needed to create the application. The data was
  stored remotely that an admin can access and modify. The app was programmed with React Native a JavaScript framework
  thatâ€™s capable of running both on Android and iOS. It utilizes Firebase as Mobile Backend as a Service and Google
  Sheets as a Database.

<p>
  The iterative development process used for this project was first to set goals and understanding sponsor requirement,
  second is creating wireframe, third is define user scenarios for the wireframes, fourth is building the prototype,
  fifth is User testing, and the final step is present the prototype to sponsors.
</p>
<p>
  The project required testing on different software versions (i.e. Android 7, Android 8, etc.), screen sizes, and
  operating systems (Android and iOS). Apps were tested with Android and iOS Emulators for each component in the app it
  would be tested till outcomes were satisfied with the expected results. User Testing was another approach taken in
  process to test out the mobile app a total of 17 people have testedit. After months of meeting with a sponsor,
  redesigning features and testing the application is close to completion.
