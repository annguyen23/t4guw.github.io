    <p>
      During my internship with Amazon Web Services, I worked in a team of Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3)
      organization. Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability,
      reliability, security, and performance. S3 is designed to guarantee 99.999999999% (11 nines) of durability, and stores
      data for millions of applications for companies around the world. As such, it is critical to continuously test and
      verify that S3 can handle the most demanding customer workloads.
    </p>
    <p>
      My project was to generate and implement a performance testing scenario regarding the concurrency S3 could handle.
      This project was completed over the course of a three-month internship period. I was able to deliver to my goals and
      exceed my commitments by implementing additional functionalities. My testing scenario was integrated into the codebase
      and is now run as a part of the pre-production testing and release cycle. Through my project, I was able to learn and
      get hands-on experience on distributed systems, hardware and buffering algorithms, testing methodologies, and code
      quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my internship, I was able to learn skills relating to working in a team environment such as using source
      control for software, testing code in production-like environments, and receiving and incorporating design and code
      review feedback from teammates. I participated in the team’s milestone planning and took part in all phases of the
      software development life cycle. I completed my internship with a presentation and successful project demo to my team
      and organization.
