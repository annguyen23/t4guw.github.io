      During the summer, I interned at Siemens Healthineers as a technical intern. Siemens Healthineers is a company with a
      location in Issaquah that focuses on the development of ultrasound devices for the healthcare field. The main task
      that I worked on over the summer for my capstone project was to design and develop a working proof of concept
      application to facilitate the control of ultrasound software on a separate device over a network.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were multiple iterations of the project that changed as different requirements and use-cases came. Originally,
      the project was only intended to be a C# program that made use of a VNC variantâ€™s API to allow the remote control of
      an ultrasound machine over the same local network. However, the project eventually involved the development of C#,
      WPF, and XAML code on the pre-existing codebase with the Google RPC library (gRPC) to facilitate communication. The
      first version to use gRPC involved the definition of relevant methods for the ultrasound software using protocol
      buffers a type of file used by gRPC to define messages for serialization and communication. The second iteration of
      the project involved streamlining the development process by using reflection and the proxy pattern to intercept the
      types and messages sent from the remote platform rather than implementing every combination of functions and message
      types.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project involved performing several duties of a software engineer, including the development of diagrams, the
      documentation of the project, participating in standups and formal meetings with the stakeholders and providing
      concise and informative updates. I found myself using the Microsoft development stack of MSTest for testing, Visual
      Studio for an IDE, Team Foundation Server as version control, Gliffy for diagramming, and Confluence for
      documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the internship, I was able to deliver a responsive application that supported much of the ultrasound
      functionality. The final iteration was built using C#, WPF, XAML, and Google RPC (gRPC), successfully built, tested,
      and deployed on a Windows Surface. The results were satisfactory, and the code base exists as a separate branch.
