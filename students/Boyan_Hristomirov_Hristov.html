      Windows restrict the length of the path within which you can access files. If the path is larger than 216/260
      characters, the files become inaccessible, yet the longest possible path in Windows is 32767 characters. I was
      assigned to create a GUI with a Windows Form App in C# which uses Windows API through marshalling, to enumerate the
      files in a path. I had to implement functions for copy, search, delete, and view. In order to solve this problem, I
      researched the Windows API. I used DFS-style traversal for removal and BFS-style traversal for all other operations.
      The head developer, also my mentor, brought to my attention that the GUI would freeze whenever a longer operation was
      running. This was due to the main thread being the executing thread. I solved this problem by researching
      multithreading in C# and writing asynchronous code. This allows for tasks that do not involve directly updating the
      GUI to be run on a separate thread which allows the main thread to continue waiting for events from the user. In the
      case in which the GUI update is happening within a function run by a thread other than the main thread, the main
      thread has to be invoked to perform the GUI update or the update of the resource which doesnâ€™t belong to the current
      thread. I also included a cancellation option in case the user decides to interrupt the operation if it is taking too
      long or the user changes their mind. I accomplished this through a Cancellation Token which can be used to send a
      signal that would throw an Exception that will interrupt the execution of the currently running task. I chose to write
      asynchronous code because it accomplishes larger tasks more quickly and it maintains the responsiveness of the GUI.
      Working on this project, I learned about C#, Windows Forms, Windows API, multithreading, events, marshalling, data
      binding, reference and value types, code reusability, code maintenance, and generics.
