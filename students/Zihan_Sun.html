    <p>
      In the internship with Sensitech Technology this summer, I worked on two desktop applications. These applications were
      developed by using C#, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), SOAP protocol. The main goal for these two applications
      is to let the manipulation on eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Xml Document Transformation (XDT) easier locally
      and easier on remotely database. In the meantime, these two applications also aimed to give the users the ability of
      version control of their XML database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first application I worked on was aimed to make manipulation on remotely database which is storing XML files and
      it also let the user to choose software name and version to check what files they would have in that specific version.
      This application will connect to user’s XML database after login. The application has mainly 4 functionalities, add
      new XML file, add new XDT file for an XML file specifically, and delete file from database. After login, the user
      would be able to see the version check page, it will gather the user’s laptop information automatically, the user
      would be able to choose software name and version number and see all the files they would download. In the meantime,
      the user would also be able to choose the what do they want to do to the database, such as add or delete files. In the
      add new, add XDT, and delete page, the user would have a preview section of editing file and preview the outcome files
      in the database. All the modification user make in this application would make changes to local directory and remotely
      database at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second application I worked on, it is mainly focus on making changes to the XML and XDT files in the local
      directories. After the user open and running this application, they would be able to select the directory/ software
      solution (for C#) they want to modify. After they selected the directory they wanted, the project would populate the
      content of that directory (only XML and XDT files). The application has an editing section to make changes to the
      files and the user would also be able to select all the XDTs they want to apply to the XML file they selected and set
      the order they want to apply. After that the preview of what the XML looks like after applied all the XDTs user select
      would be showed in the preview section.
