  Since January 2019, I have been working as an intern in the Digital Future Lab. For the month of January, I worked as
  a Quality Assurance tester on our release push for the 1.2.0 update to the lab ‘s first commercially released game,
  Ghostlight Manor.
</p>
<p>
  Since February, I have been working as a developer on the lab’s next upcoming game, SEED. During my time working on
  SEED, I have developed and improved many interesting systems, including a level design tool which greatly ‘mproved the
  workflow of our design team by allowing designers to easily and simply control al/ variables in their level from
  central hub. I also worked on an in-depth dialog system which supported dialog options and XML parsing for rich text
  upport.
</p>
<p>
  In my capacity as a developer, I have learned and honed many skills pertaining to working in a team environment, sing
  version control software (particularly Git and Sourcetree), and using the Unity Engine. The final build of SEED is
  lated to be demoed at Seattle Indies Expo at PAX on the 1 st of September, and a completely finalized build will be
  e/eased online on the 13th. My time at the lab has taught me valuable lessons not only in my field, but in ways of
  diversity, quity, and inclusion, values which the lab holds as its core philosophy.
