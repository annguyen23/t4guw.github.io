    Due to the global pandemic there has been a lot of uncertainty as to how businesses will function for the
    foreseeable future. Hiring is down across the board with entry-level job posting on Glassdoor being down 68%.
    There's even concern among those currently employed about their positions within the company, especially with
    start-ups. With these factors it's incredibly important for those finishing their degree to be prepared for the
    added stress that comes with taking a technical interview.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Tech for Good research team we are working to address this issue to provide better technical interview
    preparation for computer science students. There are several websites that provide practice coding problems. My team
    focuses on the Leetcode web site and converts practice questions into in-depth lessons. Our goal is to assist
    students develop a deeper understanding of these problems by highlighting code efficiency, memory usage, and
    alternative data structures that can be used. Our lessons provide a step-by-step approach to help students become
    better problem solvers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently our team has over 100 lessons completed on our Stepik lesson page covering multiple categories, data
    structures, and difficulty levels. We also have put in place weekly workshops to CSS 342 students in order to get
    additional feedback for the lessons we have compiled. Formal computer science courses at the University of
    Washington Bothell provide the theoretical framework of students to learn. This project supplements student's
    knowledge through problem-solving activities to better prepare students for the skills and mindset they will need
    for technical interviews.
