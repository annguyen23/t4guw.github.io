  <h3>Deconstructing a Technical Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Companies routinely use technical interviews when hiring software developers. As the tech industry has grown, these
    technical interviews have become increasingly competitive. Even students who have done well in courses, have to
    study explicitly for these technical interviews over several months.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our solution to addressing these concerns was to develop a course designed to help third and fourth year students
    practice common types of interview questions. These lessons so far consist of 117 common interview questions from
    the website LeetCode.com in various topics that include strings, arrays, linked lists, binary search trees, and
    more. To date, the course has had 196 registered students.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solving these problems, often under a time limit and in front of others, can be intimidating. Knowing how to
    implement a specific data structure or being able to calculate runtime complexity of an algorithm is only half of
    answering technical interview questions. Students need to be able to thoroughly explain their process while arriving
    at their solution. Technical interviews are as much about showing that you are able to work through a problem as
    they are about finding the correct solution. Often there is more than one solution to a problem and having the
    ability to explain oneâ€™s choice is a crucial process.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to assist UW students prepare for technical interviews by not just practicing coding problems, but
    offering detailed explanations as to how the solution was obtained. Practicing for a technical interview usually
    involves working through several common questions and checking for accuracy. Our approach seeks to help students
    develop the skills required to decompose any problem and solve it systematically. Developing this skill set assists
    students in succeeding at technical interviews. Additionally, this course has helped students develop
    problem-solving skills that will help them throughout their education and careers in CS.
